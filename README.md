# AUT Thesis

## Introduction

This is basically AUT Thesis template downloaded from Overleaf on ????,
then refactored for a more consistent directory structure.

I also changed the font from B Nazanin cause I don't really like it.
You may want to change it back, as it is the font of choice for
university matters.

## Description

Run `make setup`, then `make`.

Each time you run `make clean`, make sure to run `make setup` afterwards.

## Requirements

No bragging but, I'm a UNIX guy, so I spend most of my time behind a computer
in the Terminal. Hence, I use `make`, which in turn uses `latexmk` to create PDF 
output.
