# AUT Thesis

## Introduction

This is basically AUT Thesis template downloaded from Overleaf on ????,
then refactored for a more consistent directory structure.

I also changed the font from B Nazanin cause I don't really like it.
You may want to change it back, as it is the font of choice for
university matters.

## Description

To get started, run `make setup`. Then, `make`. If you have all the
required TeX packages and programs, the output PDF file should open to
you.
